This is a simple script for changing the visibility of all your spotify playlists at once.

To use it, you need to have valid API credentials from spotify. (You can get those by creating a "spotify for developers" account and creating an app in their dashboard)

Make sure to add the url you use to that spotify app, so that it can authenticate your credentials. 

You also need spotipy. You can install it with pip.

To run the script, enter your credentials into credentials.py and then run the script.
